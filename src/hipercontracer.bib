	abstract = "{Nowadays, we see a steadily increasing number of Internet devices with connections to multiple networks. For example, every smartphone provides mobile broadband and Wi-Fi connectivity. Multi-path transport protocols, like MPTCP, CMT-SCTP or Multipath-QUIC, allow for utilising all connected networks simultaneously. However, while there is a lot of research on the Transport Layer aspects of multi-path transport, there is not much work on the Network Layer perspective, yet.
In this paper, we introduce our Open Source tool HiPerConTracer (High-Performance Connectivity Tracer) for efficient, parallelised, long-term measurements of the path connectivity characteristics among multi-homed Internet systems. HiPerConTracer is now running as a permanent feature in the NorNet Core infrastructure, which is used for research on multi-homed systems, and in particular for research on multi-path transport. Based on the HiPerConTracer data collected in NorNet Core so far, we finally present some interesting results from the analysis of the inter-continental site connectivity between China and Norway in January 2020.

	abstract = "{Accurately measuring Round-Trip Times (RTT) for Internet communications is important for various research topics, ranging from protocol performance and congestion control to routing and network security. Unix systems, particularly Linux and FreeBSD, provide some features to obtain network packet timing information, but there is a lack of documentation for these. With High-Performance Connectivity Tracer (HiPerConTracer), there is already an open source tool for running large-scale, long-running and high-frequency ICMP Ping and Traceroute measurements. However, it lacks support of high-precision timing.
As part of this paper, first the network packet timestamping features of Unix systems are analysed and introduced, to provide the reader with a detailed overview over the available methods, their usage, as well as their limitations. Then, enhancements to HiPerConTracer are presented for adding high-precision timestamping support, as well as a UDP module to also perform UDP Ping and Traceroute measurements. Finally, the newly added features are demonstrated in a proof-of-concept analysis.}",
