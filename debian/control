Description: High-Performance Connectivity Tracer (HiPerConTracer)
 High-Performance Connectivity Tracer (HiPerConTracer) is a Ping/Traceroute
 measurement framework. HiPerConTracer denotes the actual measurement
 tool. It performs regular Ping and Traceroute runs among sites, featuring:
 multi-transport-protocol support (ICMP, UDP); multi-homing and parallelism
 support; handling of load balancing in the network; multi-platform
 support (currently Linux and FreeBSD); high-precision (nanoseconds)
 timing support (Linux timestamping, both software and hardware); a
 library (shared/static) to integrate measurement functionality into other
 software (libhipercontracer); open source and written in a performance-
 and portability-focused programming language (C++) with only limited
 dependencies.
 .
 Furthermore, the HiPerConTracer Framework furthermore provides additional
 tools for helping to obtain, process, collect, store, and retrieve
 measurement data: HiPerConTracer Viewer Tool for displaying the contents
 of results files; Results Tool for merging and converting results files,
 e.g. to create a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file; Sync Tool for copying data
 from a measurement node (vantage point) to a remote HiPerConTracer Collector
 server (via RSync/SSH); Reverse Tunnel Tool for maintaining a reverse SSH
 tunnel from a remote measurement node to a HiPerConTracer Collector server;
 Collector/Node Tools for simplifying the setup of HiPerConTracer Nodes and a
 HiPerConTracer Collector server; Trigger Tool for triggering HiPerConTracer
 measurements in the reverse direction; Importer Tool for storing measurement
 data from results files into SQL or NoSQL databases. Currently, database
 backends for MariaDB/MySQL PostgreSQL, MongoDB) are provided; Query
 Tool for querying data from a database and storing it into a results
 file; Database Shell as simple command-line front-end for the underlying
 database backends; Database Tools with some helper scripts to e.g. to join
 HiPerConTracer database configurations into an existing DBeaver (a popular
 SQL database GUI application) configuration; UDP Echo Server as UDP Echo
 (RFC 862) protocol endpoint; Wireshark dissector for HiPerConTracer packets.
 .
 This package contains the actual HiPerConTracer program.

Description: HiPerConTracer Query Tool to query results from a database
 High-Performance Connectivity Tracer (HiPerConTracer) is a Ping/Traceroute
 measurement framework. HiPerConTracer denotes the actual measurement
 tool. It performs regular Ping and Traceroute runs among sites, featuring:
 multi-transport-protocol support (ICMP, UDP); multi-homing and parallelism
 support; handling of load balancing in the network; multi-platform
 support (currently Linux and FreeBSD); high-precision (nanoseconds)
 timing support (Linux timestamping, both software and hardware); a
 library (shared/static) to integrate measurement functionality into other
 software (libhipercontracer); open source and written in a performance-
 and portability-focused programming language (C++) with only limited
 dependencies.
 .
 Furthermore, the HiPerConTracer Framework furthermore provides additional
 tools for helping to obtain, process, collect, store, and retrieve
 measurement data: HiPerConTracer Viewer Tool for displaying the contents
 of results files; Results Tool for merging and converting results files,
 e.g. to create a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file; Sync Tool for copying data
